There is an endpoint:

http://oboy.smilebasicsource.com/stream/<someName>

* POST raw data to this endpoint to append to the given stream (can be any name). 
* GET to read the entire stream.
* GET with ?start=# to read from a given offset.
* If start > stream length, endpoint will block until data comes in

An example can be seen at http://oboy.smilebasicsource.com/random/mini/um?<roomName>
It is a supremely simple chat built on top of the stream


Note: streams can only go up to 5mb for now. They are not persisted to disk yet.
